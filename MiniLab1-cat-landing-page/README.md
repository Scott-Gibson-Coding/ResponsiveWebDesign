MiniLab 1: Basic HTML Cat Landing Page

This first mini lab introduces me to the basic structure of an html file, and
[text, img, link, list, figure, form] elements and many of their attributes.

It builds a simple linear page with no styling, and looks very plain as web
pages did when the web was new.
