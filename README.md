# Responsive Web Design

This is the work I did during the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course
which teaches the basics of HTML and CSS.

The Mini-labs are very hand holding, and walk you essentially line-by-line
through the labs. Whereas, the projects give you a list of requirements,
and the process to fulfil those requirements is left to the learner. While
I like the projects a lot more because of this, I'm not going to spend too
much time worrying about styling them differently or changing them from
the provided examples.

HTML/CSS is important to my learning, but not my highest priority. I just
wanted solid foundations in the topics before I return to creating reactive
web pages with Javascript and Python.
