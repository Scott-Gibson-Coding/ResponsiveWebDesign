Curriculum Project 5: Personal Portfolio Webpage

Create a webpage showing off personal portfolio projects. This webpage will
be a mock one, I plan on copying the elements provided by the FreeCodeCamp
example, and figuring out the styling myself.

Again, focusing more on the technical aspect than the creative one.
