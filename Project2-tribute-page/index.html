            <h2>Here's some info about the duck</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I couldn't come up with anything in particular I wanted to talk about. So we find ourselves here
                    talking about a duck.</li>
                <li>The aforementioned duck in question is a random image I found from google. The image path was too
                    large, so I downloaded it to be loaded locally in HTML.</li>
                <li>Not sure if I want to keep referring to this duck as just "duck", so I'm gonna call him Steve.</li>
                <li>You can tell it's a male duck due to the ugly color clashing of green, yellow, and the brown-ish
                    gray feathers.</li>
                <li>Female ducks on the other hand tend to look a lot nicer, in my area they have a brown coat of
                    feathers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
