                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.

            </header>
            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.

                <h1>Hello world</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>greetMe("World");</code>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
            <header>
                <h1>Constants</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier
                is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can
                contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p><code>const PI = 3.14;</code></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                example:
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p><code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR</code></p>
                <p><code>function f() {};</code></p>
                <p><code>const f = 5;</code></p>
                <p><code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO</code></p>
                <p><code>function f() { const g = 5; var g; }</code></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p><code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};</code></p>
                <p><code>MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code></p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>
                <h1>while statement</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p><code>while (condition) statement</code></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops
                and control is passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
            <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example - the following while loop iterates as long as <i>n</i> is less than three:
            </p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <p><code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                following values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates. </p>
